dropwizard metrics
==================

This repository is intended to reference stored artifacts from
https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics in archiva, via git-fat. This is useful
for example to deploy such artifacts via trebuchet by including this
repository.

Not all artifacts may have been imported, if that's not the case
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Archiva contains detailed instructions on
how to upload new artifacts.
